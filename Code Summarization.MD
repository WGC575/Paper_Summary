- **Problem**: The quality of benchmark dataset may not be as high as expected.
- **Approach**: Proposed an automated code-comment cleaning tool that can detect noises in data that are caused by inappropriate preprocessing operations.
- **Evaluation**: Demonstrated these noises impact analysis negatively, and the proposed tool can effectively improve the performance of code summarization.
