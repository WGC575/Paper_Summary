There and back again: Can you compile that snapshot?

This thesis mainly focus on the relationship between the Broken Intervals (BI), 
Change History (CH) and Compilability based on 100 projects from Apache Software 
Foundation.

The main results lies on that 

1. many of the snapshots are incompilable.
2. more recent snapshots are less likely to be incompilable.
3. Most incompilablilty problems result from resolution (i.e. dependencies)
