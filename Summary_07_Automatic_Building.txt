Automatic Building of Java Projects in Software Repositories: A Study on Feasibility and Challenges

This thesis mainly works on the:
1. Building success rate
2. Taxonomy on the root cause
3. Identification of root cause
4. Resolving incompilability

results mainly lies on:
1. Low incompilability
2. Environment, Process, Project
3. README, Build Log
4. Building command, Version Reverting, Dummy File Generation, Other Types of Failures

Feasibility of auto building:
1. Reverting platform to all possible versions.
2. Generating dummy property files.
