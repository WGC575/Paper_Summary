## Problem

AI can create code, but precise description cannot be automatically generated.

Note: What is "a precise description"? This needs to be defined and defended

## Discussion

There exist some notations matching natural language descriptions to formal specifications that can be used to generate code.
The problem here is what is new in this tool?

## General Concerns

- Defined the problem space, explain what has been done and what has not been done, and explain why the problem has not been solved yet. 
- Propose the new approach/theory to solve the problem.
- Narrow the scope and collect/reuse data.
