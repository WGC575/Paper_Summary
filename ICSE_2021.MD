## AndroEvolve: Automated Update for Android Deprecated-API Usages

<https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9402544>

- **Problem to solve**: Deprecated Android API usages should be updated to ensure the compatibility in different versions of the OS. Note, this is not a "detection" tool, but an "Updating tool".
- **Solution**: They designed a tool, AndroEvolve that over-performs the state-of-the-art tool, CocciEvolve.
- **Technical Aspects**: N/A

## APIScanner - Towards Automated Detection of Deprecated APIs in Python Libraries

<https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9402693>

- **Problem to solve**: Python 3rd-party packages get deprecated frequently.
- **Solution**: This paper present a tool that detects deprecated elements in Python APIs.
- **Technical Aspects**: AST.

## MigrationAdvisor: Recommending Library Migrations from Large-Scale Open-Source Data

<https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9402644>

- **Problem to solve**: It's hard to make optimal choices when migrating libraries.
- **Solution**: This paper present a web tool that give advice on which (JAVA) library is the best choice for developers.
- **Technical Aspects**: N/A

## GraphGallery: A Platform for Fast Benchmarking and Easy Development of Graph Neural Networks Based Intelligent Software

<https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9402641>

- **Problem to solve**: N/A
- **Solution**: It provides a tool that people can easily use to deploy GNNs for their own purposes.
- **Technical Aspects**: Graphical Neural Networks (GNNs)

## BLOCKEYE: Hunting for DeFi Attacks on Blockchain

<https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9402298>

- **Problem to solve**: The nature of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) possess an open field for attackers. Thus, it is critical to detect and mitigate or resolve them.
- **Solution**: The paper proposes a tool that provides: (1) real-time attack detection. (2) A transaction monitor that sends transactions to associated projects for further analysis.
- **Technical Aspects**: Symbolic reasoning.
