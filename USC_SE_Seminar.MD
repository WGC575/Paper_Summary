## 9/30 Amirmohammad - Explainable Program Synthesis by Localizing Specifications

- Online source:

- **Summary**: Allow the users to interrogate the program synthesizer.
- **Motivation**: Help programmers with coding tedious code, but the synthesis doesn't work for all situations. So we want to have ability to help users to interrogate the synthesizer.
- **Approach**: Two groups with 9 students each, tested with/without sub-specification. The sub-specifications are some more information, details about part of the entire requirement.
- **Questions**: The average coding level may vary between two groups. (By the way, the times given to two groups are also different.)
